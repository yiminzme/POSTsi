>  YELP: The YELP review dataset [18] is composed of a user-business-time (year-month) tensor, a user-user (friendship) matrix, and a business-category matrix: e.g., a tensor element (’John’, ’starbucks’, ’2014-06’, ’3’) means that John visited starbucks in June, 2014 and gave 3 rating to the business; a user-user matrix element (’10’, ’20’, ’1’) means that user ’10’ and ’20’ are friends; and a business-category matrix element (’Wall Mart’, ’Grocery’, ’1’) means that ’Wall Mart’ belongs to ’Grocery’ category
